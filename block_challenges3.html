<h1>How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Block</h1>

<strong>Harder, better, faster, stronger</strong>



<h2>Destructuring arguments</h2>

<p>
Get ready to "whaaaaa?! O.o"
So, block assignment is like local variable assignment.
Here, we can use destructuring to extract arguments from an array.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">a = [1, 2]
p a
lambda { |a| p a }.call([1, 2])

a, b = [1, 2]
p a, b
lambda { |a, b| p a, b }.call([1, 2])
</div>

<p>
You can have multiple layers of destructuring through parentheses.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">(a, (b, c), (d, e)) = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]
p a, b, c, d, e</div>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Where might something like this be useful?
<p>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
Hashes are key/value pairs. These are passed to the block as an array.
Show that you can receive the pair if you want (the array),
or use destructuring to get the key/value pair.
<p>

<p>
Does this work for keyword arguments, too?
<p>

<p>
Do methods work with this kind of assignment?
<p>

<p>
Can you destructure three levels deep?
<p>




<h2>Bindings return a binding into the block's closure</h2>

<p>
There is a method that all objects inherit, called <code>binding</code>,
which returns the current binding. This is where local variables are stored,
and what determines what <code>self</code> is.
<p>

<p>
This is made private, because it's implemented in such a way that implementation
details leak out and it makes no goddam sense:
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">puts Object.new.send(:binding).eval('self')
</div>

<p>
But you can call <code>binding</code> on a block,
and it will give you a binding into its closure.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def print_block_locals(&block)
  p block.binding.eval('local_variables')
end

a, b = 1, 2
print_block_locals { }</div>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
If there were local variables in the block above,
would it print them, as well?
<p>

<p>
Find a way to get two different objects (you can check with <code>object_id</code>)
to have a reference to the same block. Is their <code>self</code> the same?
(You'll need to <code>eval("self")</code>
on the block's binding, the same way we eval'd <code>local_variables</code>).
<p>


<h2>You can change the value of <code>self</code></h2>

<p>
So here's some black fucking magic for you.
And I'm not telling you to go do this, because, I'm not your parents.
But I want what's best for you, so I'll just tell you that metaprogramming is the devil's work,
but your other instructors and I, we know that you're curious about these things,
and all your friends are experimenting with metaprogramming.
So, we'd rather you experiment here in school, where it's safe.
<p>

<p>
So, we've seen <code>eval</code>, which, you've probably heard is evil,
but if you really wanted to turn it up to eleven, then read on.
A block
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ab38e5b5851288753e841182f112d778d713dc91/vm_core.h#L524">has a reference to self</a>,
So if Ruby exposed a way to change the value of self for a block... well...
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">"abc".instance_eval { p self }
123.instance_eval { p self }</div>

<p>
Now, you'll quickly find yourself frustrated because you can't pass arguments to the block.
There's a decent solution available, though. Try calling <code>methods</code> on the block,
do you see any that look promising? (their names are similar to <code>instance_eval</code>,
and you can filter the results by calling <code>grep</code> on them and passing it a regex).
Can you find the method? Can you find its limitations?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLDv-fUINM">Here's a hint</a>.
<p>

<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong> The following material may has been known to cause epistemological unsettledness.
<p>

<p>
And now, if you really want to revel with the devil,
figure out what the difference is between
<code>instance_eval</code> and <code>class_eval/module_eval</code>.
And then, to truly stare into the abyss,
figure out how Ruby is able to accomodate these differences.
Be sure to say goodbye to your loved ones.
For one day, dear student, you may wake up wide-eyed and realize that metaprogramming is just programming.
And all that shit you thought was programming? All those keywords?
The <code>class</code>, the <code>module</code>, the <code>def</code>...
how in the fuck do they pull that off?
And then you will see: everything you believed is a lie.
<p>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What does this mean in terms of instance variables?
</p>


<h2>The transition from Proc to block and back remembers what object it is</h2>

<p>
Here's some more magic for you. When ou pass a Proc through the block slot,
it retains its idenity on the other side.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def m1(&b)
  p b.object_id
  m2(&b)
end

def m2(&b)
  p b.object_id
end

m1 { }
</div>


<h2>You can turn a method into a block, but not an unbound method</h2>

<p>
So here's one that will seem strange at first.
think about why this might be.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def m(&b)
  p b.call
end

# the method
m(&method(:object_id))

# the instance method bound to main
m(&method(:object_id).owner.instance_method(:object_id).bind(self))

# the unbound instance method
m(&method(:object_id).owner.instance_method(:object_id))</div>


<h2>Some challenges!</h2>

<p>
Create a class that is initialized with a block,
saves it in an instance variable,
and doesn't invoke it until you call <code>omghi</code> on it.
<p>

<hr />

<p>
Fill in the body of <code>b2</code> to get it to print 3.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">b1 = lambda { 2 }
b2 = lambda {  } # what can you put in the block to get it to print 3?

puts b2.call(1, &b1)</div>

<hr />

<p>
Write your own map method: It takes an array and a block.
Each item in the array is passed to the block.
The method returns an array of items that were returned by the block.
<p>

<hr />

<p>
Write your own select method: It takes an array and a block.
Each item in the array is passed to the block.
The method returns an array of items for which the block returned true.
<p>
