<h1>Block Challenges</h1>

<p>
A block is a piece of code that can be executed later.
Its behaviour is very very similar to a method's.
You will know when you see a block, because it is always passed to a method,
and it has either curly braces or <code>do/end<code> wrapped around it.
Like <code>{ this }</code> and like <code>do this end</code>.
</p>

<h2>Passing/calling a block</h2>

<p>
We pass a block to our code the same way we pass it to
<code>#each</code> and <code>#map</code>
and anywhere else that you've seen a block.
</p>

<p>
We receive the block with an ampersand.
You can think of it like "&amp; I'd like a block".
</p>

<p>
We invoke the block with <code>#call</code>.
In the same way we can call a method and pass it arguments,
we can pass arguments to the block by passing them to <code>#call</code>.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">class MahClass
  def gimme_numbahz(&block)
    block.call 123
    block.call 456
    block.call 789
  end
end

ary = [1, 2, 3]
ary.each do |n|
  puts "Array#each gave me: #{n}"
end

mah_instance = MahClass.new
mah_instance.gimme_numbahz do |n|
  puts "One of mah numbahz: #{n}"
end</div>

<h2>Every method takes a block</h2>

<p>
Whether the method says so or not, it takes a block.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">def noblock_method
end
noblock_method { puts "noblock_method" }

def block_method(&block)
end
block_method { puts "block_method" }

def block_call(&block)
  block.call
end
block_call { puts "block_call" }</div>

<h3>Experiments!!</h3>

<p>
What would happen if you called the block twice in <code>block_call</code>?
<p>

<p>
What would happen if you passed a block to <code>puts</code>,
<code>local_variables</code>, and <code>Object.class</code>?
Why did that happen?
