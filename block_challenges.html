<h1>Block Challenges</h1>

<p>
A block is a piece of code that can be executed later.
Its behaviour is very very similar to a method's.
You will know when you see a block, because it is always passed to a method,
and it has either curly braces or <code>do/end</code> wrapped around it.
Like <code>{ this }</code> and like <code>do this end</code>.
</p>

<h2>Passing/calling a block</h2>

<p>
We pass a block to our code the same way we pass it to
<code>#each</code> and <code>#map</code>
and anywhere else that you've seen a block.
</p>

<p>
We receive the block with an ampersand.
You can think of it like "&amp; I'd like a block".
</p>

<p>
We invoke the block with <code>#call</code>.
In the same way we can call a method and pass it arguments,
we can pass arguments to the block by passing them to <code>#call</code>.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">class MahClass
  def gimme_numbahz(&block)
    block.call 123
    block.call 456
    block.call 789
  end
end

ary = [1, 2, 3]
ary.each do |n|
  puts "Array#each gave me: #{n}"
end

mah_instance = MahClass.new
mah_instance.gimme_numbahz do |n|
  puts "One of mah numbahz: #{n}"
end</div>

<h2>Every method takes a block</h2>

<p>
Whether the method says so or not, it takes a block.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">def noblock_method
end
noblock_method { puts "noblock_method" }

def block_method(&block)
end
block_method { puts "block_method" }

def block_call(&block)
  block.call
end
block_call { puts "block_call" }</div>

<h3>Experiments!!</h3>

<p>
What would happen if you called the block twice in <code>block_call</code>?
<p>

<p>
What would happen if you passed a block to <code>puts</code>,
<code>local_variables</code>, and <code>Object.class</code>?
Why did that happen?
<p>


<h2>Normal arguments and a block</h2>

<p>
Blocks are declared as the last argument.
<p>

<p>
Can you define <code>have_some_args</code> so that it doesn't blow up?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">have_some_args(1, 2, 3) { 4 }
</div>


<h2>Blocks aren't counted with arity</h2>

<p>
Arity is the number of arguments that a method takes.
<p>

<p>
What do you think the arity will be for these methods?
Go ahead and guess,
then mimic the first line against the other methods to find out if you're right.
<p>

<p>
The last one is a little tricky,
read the title of this section before you answer it :)
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def a
end
puts method(:a).arity

def b(arg)
end

def c(arg1, arg2)
end

def d(arg1, arg2, &block)
end</div>

<p>
Can you think of any other arugment types?
Are you able to guess how they affect arity?
Were any of your guesses wrong?
If so, can you think of a reason you might have gotten a different answer than you expected?
<p>


<h2>There can only be one block argument</h2>

<p>Ruby only allows you to pass one block. This is built into
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/c5c5e96643fd674cc44bf6c4f6edd965aa317c9e/vm_core.h#L164">the structure of a method call</a>.

<p>
For a bit about the history of why we have blocks,
and why they are the way they are, see
<a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2015/01/16/why-does-ruby-have-blocks/">this</a>
great blog post by Avdi.
<p>

<p>
I'd try showing an example, but I'm not even sure what it would look like to try it.
<p>

<p>
There was a pretty cool
<a href="http://codebrawl.com/contests/methods-taking-multiple-blocks">Code Brawl</a>
a while back where everyone submitted code to support the use case of multiple blocks.
Some cool stuff in those gists :)
<p>

<h2>Block param when no block is given</h2>

<p>
Take a guess what you think this will be.
Try passing a block, what do you think it will be?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def m(&block)
  p block
end

m</div>

<h2>You can store blocks in a Proc</h2>

<p>
So, you can't actually do anything with a block,
because it's not really an object (hence why you can only pass it to a method).
This is, of course, problematic, so they created a class whose job is to wrap the block.
That class is called <code>Proc</code>, and you can execute the code in the block with
<code>Proc#call</code>. You can get access to one by taking it in a method,
or by instantiating a <code>Proc</code> with a block, or by calling <code>lambda</code>,
which is a private method available to all objects.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def get_block(&block)
  block
end

block1 = get_block { puts 'block 1' }
puts block1.class
block1.call

# can you show that these create Proc objects
# And can be invoked with `Proc#call`, like the one above?
# Proc.new { }
# lambda {  }</div>


<h2>Alternative way to work with blocks</h2>

<p>
What we did above, is my favourite way to work with blocks,
because it handles everything that a block can do.
But there is another syntax for working with blocks,
you'll often see this in
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/221e847a3bc4b6dc2559b4354417862b2e6c684a/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.tt#L20">Rails templates</a>.
