<h1>New Kids on the Block</h1>

<p>
This is part 1 of a three part series on blocks!
Be sure to check out
<a href="/blocks/block-it-up-and-do-it-again">part 2</a>
and
<a href="/blocks/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-block">part 3</a>
</p>

<p>
A block is a piece of code that can be executed later.
It is very similar to a method.
You will know when you see a block, because it is always passed to a method,
and it has either curly braces or <code>do/end</code> wrapped around it.
Like <code>{ this }</code> and like <code>do this end</code>.
</p>

<h2>Passing/calling a block</h2>

<p>
We pass a block to our code the same way we pass it to
<code>#each</code> and <code>#map</code>
and anywhere else that you've seen a block.
</p>

<p>
We receive the block with an ampersand.
You can think of it like "&amp; I'd like a block".
</p>

<p>
We invoke the block with <code>#call</code>.
In the same way we can call a method and pass it arguments,
we can pass arguments to the block by passing them to <code>#call</code>.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">class MahClass
  def gimme_numbahz(&block)
    block.call 123
    block.call 456
    block.call 789
  end
end

ary = [1, 2, 3]
ary.each do |n|
  puts "Array#each gave me: #{n}"
end

mah_instance = MahClass.new
mah_instance.gimme_numbahz do |n|
  puts "One of mah numbahz: #{n}"
end</div>

<h2>Curly braces vs do/end</h2>

<p>
For the most part, people treat curly braces and do/end as if they are interchangeable.
But there is one tricky difference. Curly braces will be passed as an argument to the
method call directly to their left. But <code>do/end</code>
will be passed as an argument to the
method call farthest to their left.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code"># The asterisk causes the method to ignore any arguments that are given to it
# Not part of this material, but can you think of why this might be?
def a(*)
  puts "a: #{block_given?}"
end

def b(*)
  puts "b: #{block_given?}"
end

def c(*)
  puts "c: #{block_given?}"
end

a b { }
puts "----------"
a b do
end
</div>


<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What if you called <code>a b c</code>
with curly braces and do/end?
Which method do you think they would be assigned to?
Try it to see if you are right :)
<p>

<p>
If you wanted to use curly braces,
but didn't want the block to go to the method direclty to their left,
what could you do to get them to be passed to the correct method?
<p>

<p>
You've seen this before.
Think about Rake tasks, have you ever seen curly braces in a rake task?
If not, why not, and can you find a way to use curly braces instead of do/end?
Think about RSpec test suites, can you define a test that uses curly braces,
and another that uses do/end?
<p>


<h2>Normal arguments and a block</h2>

<p>
Blocks are declared as the last argument.
<p>

<p>
Can you define <code>have_some_args</code> so that it doesn't blow up?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">have_some_args(1, 2, 3) { 4 }
</div>


<h2>You can store blocks in a Proc</h2>

<p>
So, you can't actually do anything with a block,
because it's not really an object.
To allow you to work with it, they created a class, <code>Proc</code>,
whose job is to wrap the block.
You can execute the block with
<code>Proc#call</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can get access to one by taking it in a method,
or by instantiating a <code>Proc</code> with a block, or by calling <code>lambda</code>,
a private method available to all objects.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def get_block(&block)
  block
end

block1 = get_block { puts 'block 1' }
puts block1.class
block1.call

# can you show that these create Proc objects
# And can be invoked with `Proc#call`, like the one above?
# Proc.new { }
# lambda {  }</div>


<h2>Return values</h2>

<p>
Blocks, like methods (and basically all expresions in Ruby)
return the value of the last line.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">block = lambda do
  123
  456
end
puts "Last line: #{block.call}"</div>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What would get returned if the block had nothing in it?
Try it to make sure you're right!
<p>


<h2>Blocks don't give a shit about arguments</h2>

<p>
Blocks, like methods, can receive arguments.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def gimme_moar_numbahz!(&block)
  block.call(10)
  block.call(100)
  block.call(1000)
end

gimme_moar_numbahz! { |n| puts n + 1 }</div>

<p>
Unlike methods, blocks don't care if you give the correct number of argumetnts.
This is kind of like a JavaScript function.
The case where we call it with <code>:a</code> and <code>:b</code>,
it's pretty clear what to expect.
But what about when we give it fewer or more?
What do you expect to see? Are you correct?
Can you explain what you're seeing?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def moar_args_pls(&block)
  block.call()
  block.call(:a)
  block.call(:a, :b)
  block.call(:a, :b, :c)
end

moar_args_pls do |arg1, arg2|
  puts "My args: #{arg1.inspect}, and #{arg2.inspect}"
end</div>


<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
How are a block's parameters stored?
Here are some potentially useful methods you can try calling,
in order to check if you are right:
<code>global_variables</code>,
<code>local_variables</code>,
<code>instance_variables</code>,
<code>Object.class_variables</code>
<p>

<p>
If you figured out the one above, is it true for method parameters, too?
<p>

<p>
Is this still true if you use <code>yield</code>
instead of <code>block.call</code>?
<p>

<p>
Can a block receive optional arguments?
<p>

<p>
Can a block receive... a block?!?
(did you think about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLDv-fUINM">this</a>,
too?)
<p>



<h2>Blocks can see their surrounding environment</h2>

<p>
This is one of the coolest things about blocks.
They can see variables in their surrounding environment.
We say that they "enclose" their environment,
which is why they are called "closures".
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def add_one(&block)
  puts block.call(1)
end

local_var = 2
add_one { |arg| local_var + arg + 3 }</div>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Where have you seen things like this before?
(think about the Enumerable methods)
<p>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
Is this true for methods, too?
<p>

<p>
Based on the answer to the above question, what do you think will happen with this code?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">var1 = 1
def add_one
  var2 = 2
  block = lambda { puts var1 + var2 + 3 }
  block.call
end
add_one</div>

<p>
Can blocks see instance variables, too?
If so... well, we know that instance variables are stored on the instance,
so what does that imply that <code>self</code> is?
Were you correct?
Try this in a few different contexts... does it hold?
<p>
