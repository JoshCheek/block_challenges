<h1>Block Challenges</h1>

<p>
A block is a piece of code that can be executed later.
Its behaviour is very very similar to a method's.
You will know when you see a block, because it is always passed to a method,
and it has either curly braces or <code>do/end<code> wrapped around it.
Like <code>{ this }</code> and like <code>do this end</code>.
</p>

<h2>Passing/calling a block</h2>

We pass a block to our code the same way we pass it to
<code>#each</code> and <code>#map</code>
and anywhere else that you've seen a block.

We receive the block with an ampersand.
You can think of it like "&amp; I'd like a block".

We invoke the block with <code>#call</code>.
In the same way we can call a method and pass it arguments,
we can pass arguments to the block by passing them to <code>#call</code>.

<pre><code class="interactive-code">class MahClass
  def gimme_numbahz(&block)
    block.call 123
    block.call 456
    block.call 789
  end
end

ary = [1, 2, 3]
ary.each do |n|
  puts "Array#each gave me: #{n}"
end

mah_instance = MahClass.new
mah_instance.gimme_numbahz do |n|
  puts "One of mah numbahz: #{n}"
end</code></pre>
