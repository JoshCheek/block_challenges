<h1>How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Block</h1>

<strong>Harder, better, faster, stronger</strong>

<h2>Blocks aren't counted with arity</h2>

<p>
Arity is the number of arguments that a method takes.
<p>

<p>
What do you think the arity will be for these methods?
Go ahead and guess,
then mimic the first line against the other methods to find out if you're right.
<p>

<p>
The last one is a little tricky,
read the title of this section before you answer it :)
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def a
end
puts method(:a).arity

def b(arg)
end

def c(arg1, arg2)
end

def d(arg1, arg2, &block)
end</div>

<p>
Can you think of any other arugment types?
Are you able to guess how they affect arity?
Were any of your guesses wrong?
If so, can you think of a reason you might have gotten a different answer than you expected?
<p>


<h2>Block param when no block is given</h2>

<p>
Take a guess what you think this will be.
Try passing a block, what do you think it will be?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def m(&block)
  p block
end

m</div>

<h2>Alternative way to work with blocks</h2>

<p>
What we did above, is my favourite way to work with blocks,
because it handles everything that a block can do.
But there is another syntax for working with blocks,
you'll often see this in
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/221e847a3bc4b6dc2559b4354417862b2e6c684a/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.tt#L20">Rails templates</a>.
<p>

<p>
This syntax never turns the block into a local variable.
Instead, you can use <code>block_given?</code> to see if the block exists,
and <code>yield</code> to call the block.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def keywords_with_blocks
  if block_given?
    yield
  else
    puts "No block given!"
  end
end

keywords_with_blocks
keywords_with_blocks { puts "Block was called" }</div>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What would happen if you yielded to the block when it wasn't given?
<p>

<p>
How could you check whether the block was given if you received it in a parameter?
Try it!
<p>

<p>
Does this code work the same if you receive the block in a parameter
like we've been doing above?
<p>



<h2>Destructuring arguments</h2>

<p>
Get ready to "whaaaaa?! O.o"
So, block assignment is like local variable assignment.
Here, we can use destructuring to extract arguments from an array.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">a = [1, 2]
p a
lambda { |a| p a }.call([1, 2])

a, b = [1, 2]
p a, b
lambda { |a, b| p a, b }.call([1, 2])
</div>

<p>
You can have multiple layers of destructuring through parentheses.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">(a, (b, c), (d, e)) = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]
p a, b, c, d, e</div>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Where might something like this be useful?
<p>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
Hashes are key/value pairs. These are passed to the block as an array.
Show that you can receive the pair if you want (the array),
or use destructuring to get the key/value pair.
<p>

<p>
Does this work for keyword arguments, too?
<p>

<p>
Do methods work with this kind of assignment?
<p>

<p>
Can you destructure three levels deep?
<p>


<h2>Curly braces vs do/end</h2>

<p>
For the most part, people treat curly braces and do/end as if they are interchangeable.
But there is one tricky difference. Curly braces will be passed as an argument to the
method call directly to their left. But <code>do/end</code>
will be passed as an argument to the
method call farthest to their left.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code"># The asterisk causes the method to ignore any arguments that are given to it
# Not part of this material, but can you think of why this might be?
def a(*)
  puts "a: #{block_given?}"
end

def b(*)
  puts "b: #{block_given?}"
end

def c(*)
  puts "c: #{block_given?}"
end

a b { }
puts "----------"
a b do
end
</div>


<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What if you called <code>a b c</code>
with curly braces and do/end?
Which method do you think they would be assigned to?
Try it to see if you are right :)
<p>

<p>
If you wanted to use curly braces,
but didn't want the block to go to the method direclty to their left,
what could you do to get them to be passed to the correct method?
<p>

<p>
You've seen this before.
Think about Rake tasks, have you ever seen curly braces in a rake task?
If not, why not, and can you find a way to use curly braces instead of do/end?
Think about RSpec test suites, can you define a test that uses curly braces,
and another that uses do/end?
