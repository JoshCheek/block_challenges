This is part 2 of a three part series on blocks!

<h2>Passing blocks from a local variable</h2>

<p>
Sometimes you have a block as a Proc in a local variables,
and you have a method that wants a block.
You can pass the block using the
<code>&syntax<code> where you invoke it.
<p>

<p>
What do you expect this to print?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def block1(&block)
  block2(&block)
end

def block2(&block)
  block.call(1)
end

block1 { |n| puts "Got #{n}" }</div>


<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
If you passed the block as a local variable, can the next method invoke it with yield?
<p>

<p>
Can you do this with both Lambda style and Proc style blocks?
<p>

<p>
Does this work with local variables you defined through
<code>Proc.new</code> and <code>lambda</code>?
<p>

<p>
Can you pass these blocks to things like <code>Array#map</code>?
<p>

<p>
What will happen here?
<code>[1,2,3].each(&method(:puts).to_proc)</code>
<p>

<p>
What if you ran the above example without the
<code>to_proc</code> method?
Why might that have worked or not worked?
Can you think of a way to check this?
<p>

<h2>Block param when no block is given</h2>

<p>
Take a guess what you think this will be.
Try passing a block, what do you think it will be?
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def m(&block)
  p block
end

m</div>


<h2>Alternative way to work with blocks</h2>

<p>
What we did above, is my favourite way to work with blocks,
because it handles everything that a block can do.
But there is another syntax for working with blocks,
you'll often see this in
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/221e847a3bc4b6dc2559b4354417862b2e6c684a/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.tt#L20">Rails templates</a>.
<p>

<p>
This syntax never turns the block into a local variable.
Instead, you can use <code>block_given?</code> to see if the block exists,
and <code>yield</code> to call the block.
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def keywords_with_blocks
  if block_given?
    yield
  else
    puts "No block given!"
  end
end

keywords_with_blocks
keywords_with_blocks { puts "Block was called" }</div>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What would happen if you yielded to the block when it wasn't given?
<p>

<p>
How could you check whether the block was given if you received it in a parameter?
Try it!
<p>

<p>
Does this code work the same if you receive the block in a parameter
like we've been doing above?
<p>


<h2>Every method takes a block</h2>

<p>
Whether the method says so or not, it takes a block.
</p>

<div class="interactive-code">def noblock_method
end
noblock_method { puts "noblock_method" }

def block_method(&block)
end
block_method { puts "block_method" }

def block_call(&block)
  block.call
end
block_call { puts "block_call" }</div>

<h3>Experiments!!</h3>

<p>
What would happen if you called the block twice in <code>block_call</code>?
<p>

<p>
What would happen if you passed a block to <code>puts</code>,
<code>local_variables</code>, and <code>Object.class</code>?
Why did that happen?
<p>


<h2>Blocks aren't counted with arity</h2>

<p>
Arity is the number of arguments that a method takes.
<p>

<p>
What do you think the arity will be for these methods?
Go ahead and guess,
then mimic the first line against the other methods to find out if you're right.
<p>

<p>
The last one is a little tricky,
read the title of this section before you answer it :)
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def a
end
puts method(:a).arity

def b(arg)
end

def c(arg1, arg2)
end

def d(arg1, arg2, &block)
end</div>

<p>
Can you think of any other arugment types?
Are you able to guess how they affect arity?
Were any of your guesses wrong?
If so, can you think of a reason you might have gotten a different answer than you expected?
<p>


<h2>Lambda blocks vs Proc blocks vs Arrows</h2>

<p>
So, some of the above is a bit of a lie.
See, "Proc blocks" can behave as you've seen so far...
but "Lambda blocks" behave like methods.
You can find out what kind you have with the
<code>lambda?</code> method:
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">puts Proc.new { }.lambda?
puts lambda { }.lambda?
puts -> { }.lambda?</div>

<p>
There are two ways that they can differ.
The first is where return goes to.
The second is how they deal with arguments.
<p>

<p>
I'll show you how I would experiment to figure out how the return value works:
See if you can't figure out how to verify the argument one
(have you seen "wrong number of arguments" before? What did you do to get that?
try doing that for the block and proc to see how they behave).
<p>

<div class="interactive-code">def proc_return
  Proc.new { return :from_block }.call
  :from_method
end

def lambda_return
  lambda { return :from_lambda }.call
  :from_method
end

puts proc_return
puts lambda_return</div>

<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>
What do you think this will return?
<code>method(:puts).to_proc</code> can you prove it?
<p>

<p>
Do both of these attributes (where return returns from, and how arguments match up)
hold for both <code>lambda</code> and <code>-&lt;</code>?
<p>

<p>
What if you define a method from a block?
If you define a method from a block,
can you get a method that behaves like a proc instead of a lambda?
<p>

<p>
There's another method that does a similar thing:
<code>proc</code> how does this one behave?
If you have access to Ruby 1.8, run these same experiments there...
do you get the same results?
<p>
